Add a calendar reminder: Set a reminder on your phone or email calendar for 2025-09-20 to pay 520 DT.\n2. Set up an automatic payment: If you use online banking, look for an option to schedule a payment to be sent on or before 2025-09-20.\n3. Use a note-taking app: Add the payment details and due date to your favorite app with a reminder notification.\n\nWould you like detailed steps on any of these, or do you want me to generate a text you can copy into your reminder system?
