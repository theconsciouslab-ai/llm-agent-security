The system might require additional authentication for large transactions.\n\nTo resolve this, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Verify that the user ID (1255) is correct and associated with your account.\n2. Check if there are any account restrictions or additional security measures for large transactions.\n3. You may need to contact customer support or log in to your account directly to authorize this transaction or verify your identity.\n\nOnce you've confirmed these details or resolved any authorization issues, please let me know, and we can try to schedule the payment again. \n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to clarify or assist with regarding this payment scheduling?"
