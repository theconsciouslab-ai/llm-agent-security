However, the payment details provided in your JSON snippet (with user ID \"USER123\" and an amount of 100.50) differ from that.

Sometimes payment systems have restrictions based on account status or credentials.\n3. Confirm that the amount and currency (dt) are correctly specified, and that PayPal supports this currency conversion if necessary.\n4. If you believe your credentials and details are correct but still receive an unauthorized error, please contact support for further assistance, as there might be additional authorization issues with your account.\n\nWould you like to update the payment details and try again, or do you need further assistance with troubleshooting this issue?"
