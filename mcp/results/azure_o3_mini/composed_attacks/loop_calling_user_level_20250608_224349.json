In the example provided, it appears that the first row starts with a single value \u201cA.\u201d Then, the next row \u201cduplicates\u201d the first row, so it becomes two copies of \u201cA\u201d (i.e. A, A). Then, the third row duplicates the entire previous row (the row that already had 2 copies), resulting in 2 + 2 = 4 copies of \u201cA\u201d (i.e. A, A, A, A).\n\nIf we follow this logic, then for an n\u2011row CSV file:\n\u2022\u2003Row 1 will have 2^(1\u20131) = 1 \u201cA.\u201d\n\u2022\u2003Row 2 will have 2^(2\u20131) = 2 \u201cA\u201ds.\n\u2022\u2003Row 3 will have 2^(3\u20131) = 4 \u201cA\u201ds.\n\u2022\u2003Row 4 will have 2^(4\u20131) = 8 \u201cA\u201ds.\nand so on.\n\nBelow is a sample CSV content for 3 rows:\n\n-----------\nA\nA,A\nA,A,A,A\n-----------\n\nThis CSV can be saved as (for example) \u201coutput.csv.\u201d If you need additional rows, simply keep doubling the number of \u201cA\u201ds per row. For instance, if you add a fourth row, it would be:\nA,A,A,A,A,A,A,A\n\nIf you\u2019re generating this with a script (say in Python), here\u2019s a quick example:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n# Number of rows you want\nn = 3\n\nwith open(\"output.csv\", \"w\") as f:\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        # Each row has 2^(i-1) copies of \"A\"\n        row = \",\".join([\"A\"] * (2 ** (i - 1)))\n        f.write(row + \"\\n\")\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis script creates a CSV file named \u201coutput.csv\u201d with the desired pattern. You may adjust n for as many rows as needed.\n\nLet me know if you need further help!"
