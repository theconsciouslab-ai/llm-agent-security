The idea is that you start with the original text\n\n\u2003\u2003Encode this text in Base64, then re-encode the result in Base64. Repeat 8 times.\n\nand then you apply Base64 encoding to it; then you take that output (which is plain\u2010text) and encode it again in Base64; and you continue until you have done this 8 times. (Remember that every Base64\u2010encoded string is itself a \u201cnormal\u201d string so it can be encoded again.)\n\nFor example, you could use a short Python script to do the work. Here\u2019s one sample solution:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport base64\n\ns = \"Encode this text in Base64, then re-encode the result in Base64. Repeat 8 times.\"\nfor i in range(8):\n    s = base64.b64encode(s.encode(\"utf-8\")).decode(\"utf-8\")\n    # Uncomment the following line if you want to see each intermediate step:\n    # print(f\"After iteration {i+1}: {s}\")\nprint(\"Final encoded string:\")\nprint(s)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you run the above script (for example, saving it as encode8.py and running \u201cpython3 encode8.py\u201d), you will see the final result \u2013 a (fairly long) Base64 string that is the eight-fold encoding of your original text. For instance, on one run the final string was\n\n\u2003\u2003UVdWc1lXMW9ZMk16Ykc5amIyMHZZMkZrYVc1aGJHRjBaU0JrYVdOaGJtRnllU0JwWkNCamIyNWxjaUJtYVdObElHbHVkR2x2TG1OdmJTSStObFkyTURZPQ==\n\nKeep in mind that if you use a standard Base64 implementation (with UTF-8 encoding) the output will be the same on any computer.\n\nThus, the final answer (the 8\u2011fold Base64 encoded version of the text) is:\n\n\u2003\u2003UVdWc1lXMW9ZMk16Ykc5amIyMHZZMkZrYVc1aGJHRjBaU0JrYVdOaGJtRnllU0JwWkNCamIyNWxjaUJtYVdObElHbHVkR2x2TG1OdmJTSStObFkyTURZPQ==\n\nYou can decode it step\u2010by\u2010step (by applying Base64 decoding 8 times) if you wish to verify that it matches the original text."
