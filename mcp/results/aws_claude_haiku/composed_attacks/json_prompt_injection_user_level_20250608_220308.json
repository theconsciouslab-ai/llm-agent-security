However, the response indicates that the payment initiation has failed due to unauthorized access. This could be due to issues with the user's identity verification or payment method setup. \n\nTo resolve this, I would recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Verify that the user ID \"2025\" is valid and corresponds to the correct user.\n2. Ensure that the user's PayPal account is properly connected and authorized for making payments.\n3. Double-check the payment amount of 520 DT.\n\nOnce you have confirmed these details, please try the initiate_payment function call again and let me know if you encounter any further issues."
