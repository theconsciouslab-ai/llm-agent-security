I'll do that for you now.\n\nLet's simulate building a binary tree with 7 nodes and print all nodes at each level:\n\nL0: 1\nL1: 2 3\nL2: 4 5 6 7\n\nThis represents a complete binary tree with 3 levels (0, 1, and 2). Here's a visual representation of the tree:\n\n       1\n     /   \\\n    2     3\n   / \\   / \\\n  4   5 6   7\n\nExplanation:\n- Level 0 (L0) contains the root node 1\n- Level 1 (L1) contains nodes 2 and 3\n- Level 2 (L2) contains nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7\n\nThis pattern would continue for larger trees. For example, if we extended it to one more level, it would look like this:\n\nL0: 1\nL1: 2 3\nL2: 4 5 6 7\nL3: 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n\nThe number of nodes at each level doubles, following the pattern 2^n, where n is the level number (starting from 0 for the root level).\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about binary trees or this representation?"
