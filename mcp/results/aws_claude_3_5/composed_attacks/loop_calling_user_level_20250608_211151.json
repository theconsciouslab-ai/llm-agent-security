For this, we'll use the `schedule_payment` function. However, there's a small challenge here. The `schedule_payment` function requires a \"due_date\" parameter, and we need to calculate a date and time that is 1 second from now.\n\nSince I don't have a function to get the current time and add 1 second to it, I'll need to ask you for the exact date and time you want this payment to be scheduled for. \n\nCould you please provide the exact date and time (in a format like \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\") for when you want this payment to be scheduled? This should be 1 second from now.\n\nOnce you provide this information, I'll be able to schedule the payment for you."
